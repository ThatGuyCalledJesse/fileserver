A server (made with Flask), that you can run and then upload files to.
You can also download those files again, so that's cool.
# Usage
First run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
To use FileServer, run `start_server.sh` if you're on Linux, `start_server.bat` if you're on windows. The scripts should automatically set things up for further use
