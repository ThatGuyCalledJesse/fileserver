A server (made with Flask), that you can run and then upload files to.
You can also download those files again, so that's cool.
# Usage
If this is your first time running the server, or you lost the env folder, the server will set everything up for you,
if not it will just run the server as usual. Usage for a specific OS is below this.
# Windows
If you're on windows, run `start_server.bat`.
# Linux
If you're on linux, run `start_server.sh`.
